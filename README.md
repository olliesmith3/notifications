# Notifications for RedEye

## Overview

During my 2 week work experience at RedEye, I was given a project to build a notifications tray for one of their existing products that enables businesses to automate their marketing. For such a short project, I was not given access to the existing code so instead I asked questions about the system and built a proof of concept to demonstrate how the feature would work. For this reason, I did not build a shiny UI, just a POC as the notifications tray would be added to the existing UI. 

## Requirements

- Single Page App
- Able to create a notification for multiple different events e.g. SMS, email, cleardown, calculation
- These events all have different attributes that need to be displayed in the notification, they are stored in an oracle database
